# reach-for-the-spheres

This is the code release for the paper [Reach For the Spheres:
Tangency-Aware Surface Reconstruction of SDFs](https://odedstein.com/projects/reach-for-the-spheres/).

The code in this repository uses a specific commit of gpytoolbox.
The code therein is meant to reproduce the results from the paper, and not as an up-to-date implementation of the Reach For the Spheres algorithm.
For an up-to-date implementation of the Reach For the Spheres algorithm, please consult the current version of _sdf_flow_ in gpytoolbox.

To run the code in this repository, please use Python 3.10 and compile gpytoolbox (as referenced 
as a submodule) yourself in Release mode.
Please run it in the root directory.

We are very grateful to Abhishek Madan, Chenxi Liu, Sarah Kushner, Selena Ling, and ZoÃ« Marschner for making sure this code compiles on as many machines as possible.
